A wishlist of features to add in future releases, in no particular order:

* Fix all FIXMEs
* NLS
* dolocale
* dosed
* error(): use 'caller' builtin?
* If a dependency DLL's package was not found with "cygcheck -f"
  (e.g. it was installed manually), show the DLL path instead.
* Fix rcs tarball names to allow more than one at a time
